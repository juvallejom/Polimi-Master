Real Analysis Stuff to do.

- Find all the prerrequesites for this subject
- Proof that A-bar is actually a sigma-algebra (def 5.3)
- Proof thar u-bar is a well possed function and u-bar(E)=u(F) (def 5.3)
- Try to undestarnd the proof of theorem 6.1
- Clarify the definition or the difference between mesaurable and measure sets
- Try to undesrtand tge lemma if def 6.3 (Caratheodory condition for inequualities) (lema 6.1)
- Try to undestand why the caratheodoty condition means that for a Lesbegue sigma algebra a set with null outer measure is medible. In other words
how C-condition probes that Lesbegue sigma algebra is complete
- What is a outer measure ????
- (Page 11) Probe that any open set of R can be written as a countrable union of intervals
- Try to undestand the theorem 8,1 and 8,2 of the notes.
- Undestarnd the issue with the excersice 1 of the sheet n1. The part of the contraimage of the arctan and the part of the definition of C as a closed set
is very antiintuite (oin the last time its make sense to me but i dont find a way to probe it)
